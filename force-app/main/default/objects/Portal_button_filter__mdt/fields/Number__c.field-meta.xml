    <description>Identifier for filter, used in filter logic formula on Portal button visbility record. You have to fill this manually and make sure it is unique, because we can&apos;t have triggers on custom metadata (sorry). Numbers higher than 9 are not supported because I wrote the parsing lazily.</description>
